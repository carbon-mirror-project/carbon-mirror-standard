# Pattern Proposal — Carbon Mirror Project

Thank you for proposing a new Lean Digital pattern.  
Patterns help practitioners apply the Standard in real-world environments while preserving neutrality and clarity.

This template is for:

- Example architectures  
- Model-routing heuristics  
- Scheduling strategies  
- Data-weight reduction techniques  
- Circularity or heat-reuse concepts  
- Real-world demonstrations (vendor-neutral)  

For major changes to Mirror definitions or certification criteria, use the **RFC Submission** template instead.

---

## 1. Pattern Title

Provide a concise, descriptive title.

> _Example: “Small-First Routing with Tiered Escalation Logic”_

---

## 2. Mirror Category

Which Mirror does this pattern align with?

Select one:

- [ ] Efficiency Mirror  
- [ ] Timing Mirror  
- [ ] Data Diet Mirror  
- [ ] Circularity Mirror  

If it spans multiple Mirrors, explain in section 6.

---

## 3. Description of the Pattern

What is the technique, heuristic, or example?

Describe clearly and concisely:

- The general idea  
- Where it applies  
- The problem it addresses  
- The expected behavior  

> _Example: “Route all routine workloads to a <30B model by default, escalating only when output quality fails defined thresholds.”_

---

## 4. Why This Pattern Is Useful

Explain the motivation:

- What leverage does it create?  
- What problem does it solve in real systems?  
- How does it reinforce Lean Digital principles?  

> Focus on reasoning, not marketing.

---

## 5. Requirements and Prerequisites

List any assumptions or conditions required:

- Data needed  
- Environmental considerations  
- Infrastructure patterns  
- Limitations or caveats  

Patterns must be **vendor-neutral** and widely applicable.

---

## 6. Mirror Fit and Alignment

Explain how the pattern aligns with the Mirror selected in section 2:

- Which principle(s) does it express?  
- How does it complement or extend existing guidance?  
- If it touches multiple Mirrors, clarify the relationship.  

---

## 7. Example Usage (Optional but Helpful)

Provide one or more real-world–style examples using:

- Generic (non-branded) model names  
- Generic infrastructure components  
- Tool-agnostic logic  

Examples should demonstrate clarity without implying mandatory tooling.

---

## 8. Expected Outcomes

What measurable improvements might practitioners observe?

Choose all that apply:

- [ ] Reduced energy use  
- [ ] Reduced cost  
- [ ] Reduced data movement  
- [ ] Reduced waste heat  
- [ ] Lower latency or improved P95/P99 stability  
- [ ] Increased system resilience  
- [ ] Architectural simplification  
- [ ] Other (describe): ____________

---

## 9. Risks or Considerations

List any:

- Edge cases  
- Misuse scenarios  
- Situations where the pattern might fail or mislead  
- Conditions where practitioners should avoid it  

Patterns must not create unsafe generalizations.

---

## 10. Additional Context

Include any supporting materials, such as:

- Diagrams  
- Links  
- Research notes  
- References  
- Comparative analyses  

Optional, but useful for reviewers.

Thank you for contributing to the Carbon Mirror Standard.  
Patterns are an essential part of making Lean Digital practical and reproducible across organizations.
