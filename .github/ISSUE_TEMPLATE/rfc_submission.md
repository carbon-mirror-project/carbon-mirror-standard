# RFC Submission — Carbon Mirror Project

Thank you for submitting a formal Request for Comments.  
RFCs are required for **any major change** to the Carbon Mirror Standard, including:

- Modifying the definition or structure of a Mirror  
- Changing certification criteria or level requirements  
- Introducing new core terminology  
- Rewriting or replacing a section of the Standard  
- Introducing measurement formulas or new metadata fields  
- Restructuring the Standard’s architecture  
- Deprecating long-standing guidance  
- Adding new governing principles  

RFCs allow the community and maintainers to evaluate proposals carefully, ensure rigor, and preserve the Standard’s neutrality.

---

## 1. RFC Title

Provide a concise, descriptive title for the proposed change.

> _Example: “Revised Definition of Data Mass for the Data Diet Mirror”_

---

## 2. Summary

Provide a high-level overview of the proposal in 2–4 sentences.

This should state:

- What is changing  
- Why the change is needed  
- The intended outcome  

This is the “executive summary” that reviewers will read first.

---

## 3. Motivation

Explain in detail:

- What problem this RFC addresses  
- Why the current Standard is insufficient or incomplete  
- Who is impacted  
- Evidence, data, or reasoning supporting the change  

This section should make the case for *why* the proposal matters.

---

## 4. Proposed Change

Describe the proposed modification clearly.

Include:

- New or revised text (if applicable)  
- Deleted or deprecated text (if applicable)  
- Structural changes  
- Conceptual changes  
- Definitions added or removed  

This section should be explicit enough for maintainers to evaluate without interpretation.

---

## 5. Specification / Technical Detail

Provide the deeper technical explanation, such as:

- Definitions and terminology  
- Preconditions  
- Assumptions  
- Constraints  
- Examples  
- Measurement logic  
- Evaluation steps  
- Expected interactions with existing Mirrors  

This section is where precision matters most.

---

## 6. Alternatives Considered

List all meaningful alternatives and explain:

- Why they were rejected  
- What tradeoffs they carried  
- Why the proposed option is preferable  

This section shows the proposal isn’t a one-off idea but has been thought through.

---

## 7. Impact Assessment

How will this proposal affect the following:

### Standard Structure
- [ ] No structural impact  
- [ ] Minor adjustments  
- [ ] Significant restructuring  

### Mirror Definitions
- Affected Mirror(s): __________________  
- Nature of impact: __________________

### Certification
- [ ] No changes  
- [ ] Changes to criteria  
- [ ] Changes to level definitions  

### Practitioners / Implementers
Describe any adoption, learning, or migration effects.

### Backward Compatibility
- [ ] Fully backward compatible  
- [ ] Partially compatible (explain)  
- [ ] Breaking change (explain)  

### Risks
List any risks or unintended consequences.

## 8. Drawbacks

What are the downsides of this proposal?

Examples:

- Added complexity  
- More difficult explanations  
- Risk of misuse  
- Incompatibility with existing patterns  
- Increased maintenance burden  

Honesty in this section builds reviewer trust.

---

## 9. Unresolved Questions

List questions that remain open or uncertain.

Examples:

- “Is this definition too broad?”  
- “Should this also modify the Certification Ladder?”  
- “Does this change the intent of Mirror II?”  

These guide community discussion.

---

## 10. Adoption Strategy

If the RFC is accepted, how should it be implemented?

Include:

- Timeline or phased approach  
- Migration considerations  
- Documentation updates required  
- Examples that need revision  
- Certification updates  

---

## 11. Appendices (Optional)

Include any supporting materials:

- Diagrams  
- Charts  
- References  
- Comparative analyses  
- Mathematical derivations  
- Experimental results  

---

- [ ] I have reviewed CONTRIBUTING.md  
- [ ] I have reviewed GOVERNANCE.md  
- [ ] I understand the review and consensus process  
- [ ] I have provided complete, clear technical details
