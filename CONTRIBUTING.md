# Contributing to the Carbon Mirror Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Carbon Mirror Project.  
This repository is part of an emerging open standard designed to bring clarity, efficiency, and energy literacy to digital systems.  
Your contributions—large or small—help strengthen the Standard and improve its real-world applicability.

This document explains how to contribute effectively and how the project maintains quality and consistency.

## Guiding Principles

Contributions should follow the core values of the Carbon Mirror Project:

- **Clarity over complexity**  
- **Precision over volume**  
- **Neutrality over vendor alignment**  
- **Engineering discipline over opinion**  
- **Evidence over intuition**  

The Standard is intended to be accessible, auditable, and tool-agnostic.  
All contributions should support these goals.

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute in several ways:

### 1. Improve the Standard Text
- Fix unclear phrasing  
- Propose reorganizations that improve readability  
- Add missing explanations, examples, or definitions  
- Strengthen conceptual clarity  

### 2. Submit Mirror Patterns or Examples
These must be:
- Vendor-neutral  
- Reproducible  
- Clearly scoped  
- Aligned with Level 1–3 principles  

### 3. Propose Additions via the RFC Process  
(See *GOVERNANCE.md* for details once published.)

Examples of valid RFCs:
- New architectural patterns for a Mirror  
- New measurement formats  
- Clarifications to certification criteria  

### 4. Report Issues
If something is:
- Ambiguous  
- Inconsistent  
- Outdated  
- Missing  
- Or technically incorrect  

…please open an issue.

Clear, concise issue reports are incredibly valuable.

### 5. Contribute Reference Tools (Optional)
These must remain:
- Minimal  
- Optional  
- Non-binding  
- Vendor-neutral  

Example contributions:
- Data-weight analyzers  
- Simple routing prototypes  
- Carbon-intensity schedulers  
- Diagram examples  
- Sample dashboards  

Tools must **not** redefine the Standard.

## Contribution Workflow

### Step 1 — Open an Issue First  
Before submitting a pull request, open an issue describing:

- The problem  
- The proposed change  
- The motivation  
- Expected impact  

This avoids wasted work and ensures alignment with project goals.

### Step 2 — Discuss With Maintainers  
Maintainers may request:
- Clarification  
- Narrowing the scope  
- Additional examples  
- Alignment with existing structure  

Once there is consensus, proceed with a PR.

### Step 3 — Submit a Pull Request
PR Requirements:

- Keep changes focused and minimal  
- Use clear commit messages  
- Reference the issue number  
- Follow Markdown structure conventions  
- Do not mix unrelated changes  

Large PRs may be split into multiple smaller ones.

### Step 4 — Review Process
All contributions undergo review for:

- Technical accuracy  
- Conceptual alignment  
- Neutrality  
- Reproducibility  
- Clarity  
- Structural consistency  

Projects with broad impact may require the RFC path or multi-maintainer approval.

### Step 5 — Merge and Acknowledgement
After approval:

- The PR is merged  
- Contributors are acknowledged in the repository  
- Major contributions may be cited in release notes

## Style and Formatting Guidelines

These conventions keep the Standard consistent and readable.

### Writing Style
- Use plain, direct language  
- Avoid jargon unless defined  
- Explain concepts before examples  
- Keep sections short and scannable  
- Avoid marketing tone or vendor bias  

### Markdown Structure
- H1 for file titles only  
- H2/H3 for subsections  
- Tables should use GitHub-compatible syntax  
- Code blocks for tooling examples  
- Ordered lists only where sequence matters  

### Versioning
All changes must maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly marked for a future version of the Standard.

Breaking changes require:
- RFC  
- Multi-maintainer approval  
- Release notes  
- Clear migration path  

---

## Contribution Boundaries

To maintain the Standard’s integrity:

- Do **not** add vendor-promotional content  
- Do **not** introduce tooling that implies mandatory software  
- Do **not** propose certification shortcuts  
- Do **not** embed policy advocacy  
- Do **not** change Mirror definitions without RFC  

The Carbon Mirror Standard must remain:

- Practical  
- Neutral  
- Auditable  
- Universally applicable  

---

## Code of Conduct

All contributors must follow the project’s **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**.  
Respect, clarity, and constructive collaboration are mandatory.
