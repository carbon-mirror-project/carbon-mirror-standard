# Carbon Mirror Project — Governance Model  
Updated January 2026

The Carbon Mirror Project is an open standard dedicated to improving the clarity, efficiency, and energy literacy of modern digital systems.  
To ensure consistency, neutrality, and long-term stability, the project operates under the governance model described below.

This model is intentionally lightweight at Level 1 and evolves as the Standard matures.

---

# 1. Guiding Principles

The governance of the Carbon Mirror Project is built on these foundational principles:

- **Neutrality**  
  The Standard must not privilege vendors, platforms, or specific technologies.

- **Transparency**  
  Decisions, discussions, and changes must be publicly visible.

- **Stability**  
  The Standard must not change unpredictably or in ways that break real-world usage.

- **Evidence-driven evolution**  
  Changes require clear reasoning, data, and reproducibility.

- **Inclusivity**  
  Contributors from all backgrounds and industries are welcome.

# 2. Roles and Responsibilities

The project defines the following roles:

## 2.1 Maintainers  
The maintainers are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging contributions  
- Guiding discussions and proposals  
- Ensuring consistency with project principles  
- Coordinating releases of the Standard  
- Overseeing the RFC process  
- Managing disputes and conflicts  

Maintainers have the authority to accept, request changes to, or reject contributions.

### Adding Maintainers  
New maintainers may be added by:

- Consensus of existing maintainers  
- Demonstrated long-term, high-quality contributions  
- Understanding and alignment with project philosophy  

### Removing Maintainers  
A maintainer may step down voluntarily or be removed by consensus if:

- Inactive for an extended period  
- Violating the Code of Conduct  
- Demonstrating consistent misalignment with project principles  

No single maintainer should hold unilateral long-term control.

---

## 2.2 Contributors  
Contributors include anyone who:

- Participates in discussions  
- Submits issues  
- Proposes RFCs  
- Submits pull requests  
- Provides examples, data, or patterns  
- Improves documentation  

Contributors do not require approval or formal membership.

---

## 2.3 Steering Group (Future Phase)  
As the project matures (typically around Level 3 completion), a small Steering Group may be formed to:

- Provide long-term vision  
- Review major RFCs  
- Certify formal releases of the Standard  
- Coordinate cross-industry collaboration  

The Steering Group is **not** required during early phases.

# 3. Decision-Making Process

## 3.1 Default Mode: Maintainer Consensus  
Most decisions—including PR reviews, clarifications, and documentation updates—are made by maintainer consensus.

Consensus does not mean unanimity; it means:

> “The maintainers can live with and support the change after discussion.”

If disagreement persists, an RFC may be required.

---

## 3.2 Formal Changes: The RFC Process  
Major changes to the Standard require a Request for Comments (RFC).

An RFC is required for:

- Modifying Mirror definitions  
- Changing certification criteria  
- Adding or removing levels  
- Introducing new measurement metrics  
- Creating or modifying audit procedures  
- Changes that materially affect existing adopters  

RFCs are:

- Public  
- Discussed in the open  
- Merged only after maintainer consensus  

The full RFC procedure will be documented in `/RFCs/` as the project matures.

---

## 3.3 Dispute Resolution  
If maintainers cannot reach consensus:

1. A public discussion is opened on GitHub  
2. Each position must provide clear reasoning and evidence  
3. After a defined period, a vote is held among maintainers  
4. Simple majority wins  
5. A dissenter may escalate to an RFC if the impact is large enough  

If a S
