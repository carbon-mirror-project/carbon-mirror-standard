## 🪞 What Is The Carbon Mirror?
The Carbon Mirror is an open framework for understanding, measuring, and improving the *invisible operational carbon* embedded in modern digital systems.

It is not a sustainability report.  
It is not a marketing framework.  
It is a **systems lens**—a way of seeing digital infrastructure as it actually behaves in the physical world.

The Carbon Mirror Standard defines four “Mirrors,” each revealing a different hidden dimension of digital waste:

1. **Mirror I: Efficiency** – Matching workload to the right model or compute tier  
2. **Mirror II: Timing** – Aligning workloads with low-carbon energy windows  
3. **Mirror III: Data Diet** – Reducing data mass, movement, and retention  
4. **Mirror IV: Circularity** – Turning waste heat and idle capacity into useful yield

The goal is simple:  
**Do more with less energy, less heat, less carbon, and less friction—without sacrificing output quality or velocity.**
