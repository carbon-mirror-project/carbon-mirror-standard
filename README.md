The Carbon Mirror Project is an open, vendor-neutral framework for understanding and reducing the hidden energy, carbon, and operational waste embedded in modern digital systems.

**It is not a sustainability pledge.**  
**It is not marketing.**  
**It is not about doing less.**

It is a practical method for seeing systems clearly — and operating them with greater efficiency, resilience, and leverage.

This repository contains the **Level 1 Guide**, supporting documents, governance processes, contribution guidelines, and future levels of the Standard.

## 📌 What the Carbon Mirror Is

Modern organizations run on computation the way factories once ran on energy and steel.  
The problem: in the digital world, the costs are invisible.

The Carbon Mirror provides:

* A shared language for identifying where digital systems waste energy and money
* Clear operational patterns for reducing hidden compute overhead
* A path toward cleaner, more efficient, more resilient digital infrastructure
* A standards-based certification ladder (Bronze → Silver → Obsidian)
* Mirror-based audits grounded in real engineering practice

The Carbon Mirror is built on **four Mirrors** — four ways to see what was previously invisible:

1. **Efficiency Mirror** — Model Right-Sizing
2. **Timing Mirror** — Grid Literacy
3. **Data Diet Mirror** — Payload Optimization
4. **Circularity Mirror** — Waste-to-Yield Thinking

Each Mirror reveals a different form of digital inefficiency that organizations routinely overlook.

## 🛠️ Why This Project Exists

Global compute demand is rising exponentially, driven by AI workloads.  
Electricity costs and carbon intensity are increasingly volatile.  
Regulators are beginning to mandate transparency and heat-reuse feasibility.  
Most organizations still operate blind to these realities.

The Carbon Mirror Project addresses the gap between:

* What engineers optimize (latency, uptime, cost), and
* What actually matters in a world of constrained energy and rising digital demand.

This Standard exists to turn invisible operational drag into actionable clarity.

---

## 🚦 Who This Standard Is For

* Cloud and platform engineers
* AI/ML teams
* Data engineering teams
* Sustainability and ESG teams
* CIO/CTO offices
* Infrastructure architects
* Researchers and policymakers

If your organization runs compute at scale, the Carbon Mirror applies to you.

## 📘 Level 1: The Foundation

Located in: [`/level-1-guide/`](level-1-guide/)

Level 1 teaches the foundational skills required to "see" digital systems as physical systems:

* Where computation burns unnecessary energy
* How oversized models and pipelines quietly multiply cost
* Why timing matters as much as scale
* How data mass silently drives infrastructure overhead
* How waste heat becomes a design variable instead of a byproduct

### Level 1 Certification Ladder

**Bronze — The Friction Audit**
- Identify invisible waste across the four Mirrors
- Document findings in structured evidence packet
- No automated enforcement (awareness phase)
- **Outcome:** Visibility into hidden inefficiency

**Silver — The Active Reflection**
- Implement internal carbon tax system
- Dashboard showing real-time efficiency metrics
- Departmental accountability for waste
- **Outcome:** Economic pressure toward efficiency

**Obsidian — The Disciplined System**
- Live telemetry streaming to public dashboard
- Automated tier calculation every 15 minutes
- Public accountability (auto-revocation for violations)
- **Outcome:** Verifiable, sustained efficiency

**Special Designations:**
- **Obsidian Prime:** 90%+ composite efficiency score
- **Grid Citizen:** >50% workload runs during clean grid hours
- **Apex:** Obsidian Prime + Grid Citizen (the pinnacle)

## 🔍 The Point

The Carbon Mirror exists for one reason:

**You cannot manage what you cannot see.  
And you cannot improve what you refuse to measure.**

Digital systems may be virtual, but their costs are not.

This project helps organizations capture the opportunity hiding inside that truth.
