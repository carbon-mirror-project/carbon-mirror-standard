# Carbon Mirror Project — Roadmap  
Updated January 2026

The Carbon Mirror Project is a multi-level, open standard designed to bring clarity, leverage, and energy literacy to modern digital systems.  
This roadmap outlines the evolution of the Standard, the supporting tools, and the governance framework.

---

## Phase 1 — Establishing the Foundation  
*(Current Phase: In Progress)*

### 🎯 Goals
- Publish the complete **Level 1 Field Guide**
- Create a public, open repository for the Standard
- Define the canonical structure of levels, mirrors, and terminology
- Invite early discussion, feedback, and community review

### 📦 Deliverables
- /level-1-guide/ (complete)
- LICENSE (MIT)
- CONTRIBUTING.md (baseline version)
- CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md (baseline)
- SUMMARY.md
- ROADMAP.md  
- Initial issue labels + triage workflow

### ✔ Success Criteria
- Level 1 is structurally complete and technically stable  
- Repository is ready for public consumption  
- Early users can begin applying the four Mirrors independently  

---

## Phase 2 — Level 2 Development  
*(Philosophical + Technical Mastery)*

### 🎯 Goals
- Convert Level 1 principles into structured, repeatable patterns
- Define architectural templates for each Mirror
- Expand examples, diagrams, and measurable indicators
- Introduce recommended tooling integrations

### 📦 Deliverables
- /level-2-book/ directory
- Draft chapters including:
  - Mirror-specific design patterns
  - Routing architecture templates
  - Timing windows & scheduling schemas
  - Data lifecycle decision trees
  - Waste-to-yield infrastructure checklists
- Early example dashboards (JSON/CSV structures)

### ✔ Success Criteria
- Level 2 draft provides actionable guidance for engineering teams  
- Patterns are testable and do not require vendor lock-in  
- The community can begin piloting Level 2 without formal audits  

---

## Phase 3 — Level 3 Specification (The System)  
*(Auditable, Measurable, Verifiable Standard)*

### 🎯 Goals
- Formalize metrics required for certification  
- Define automated and manual audit procedures  
- Draft the compliance model + scoring thresholds  
- Establish rules for the **Obsidian Seal**

### 📦 Deliverables
- /level-3-system/ directory
- Draft specification for:
  - Required instrumentation
  - Reporting formats
  - Audit criteria
  - Seal eligibility and renewal requirements

### ✔ Success Criteria
- Auditors can evaluate organizations using only the Level 3 spec  
- Scoring is objective, reproducible, and tool-agnostic  
- The Seal can be awarded based purely on the published rules  

---

## Phase 4 — Reference Implementations  
*(Tools that make the Standard practical)*

### 🎯 Goals
- Create open-source helpers for applying the Mirrors  
- Build minimal, modular reference tools (no monoliths)  
- Provide example monitoring dashboards

### 📦 Deliverables
- carbon-mirror-cli (optional utility)
- Example:
  - Routing classifier template
  - Cron-based timing scheduler template
  - Data-weight analyzer script
  - Heat/waste conceptual model template
- Sample dashboards via:
  - JSON schema
  - Markdown diagrams
  - CSV example datasets

### ✔ Success Criteria
- New adopters can get started in < 1 hour  
- Tools remain optional: the Standard works without them  
- Vendor neutrality preserved  

---

## Phase 5 — Community and Governance  
*(Making the Standard a living ecosystem)*

### 🎯 Goals
- Establish contributor roles and review procedures  
- Add RFCs for proposed changes  
- Begin accepting Mirror patterns, case studies, and corrections  
- Define long-term ownership structure

### 📦 Deliverables
- GOVERNANCE.md  
- RFC Process  
- Issue templates for:
  - Proposing new patterns  
  - Reporting gaps or inconsistencies  
  - Submitting case studies  
- Quarterly change cycle

### ✔ Success Criteria
- The Standard evolves through open participation  
- Governance ensures stability without stagnation  

---

## Phase 6 — First Awarding of the Obsidian Seal  
*(Historic milestone)*

### 🎯 Goals
- Identify 2–3 early adopters  
- Conduct trial audits  
- Refine the audit playbook using real-world data  
- Award the first Obsidian Seals publicly

### 📦 Deliverables
- Audit Report Template  
- Public Seal Registry  
- Case studies of certified organizations  

### ✔ Success Criteria
- The Seal is verifiably earned, not granted  
- Certification becomes a recognizable mark of operational discipline  

---

## Phase 7 — Long-Term Evolution  
*(Maintaining the Standard as technology evolves)*

### 🎯 Focus Areas
- Adapting to new compute paradigms (edge, embedded LLMs, neuromorphic, etc.)  
- Updating efficiency tiers based on emerging model ecosystems  
- Evolving Timing Mirror guidance as grids decarbonize  
- Expanding Circularity guidance for new infrastructure types  
- Integrating global policy shifts (EU, US, APAC)  

### ✔ Success Criteria
- The Carbon Mirror remains relevant for decades  
- Updates remain backward-compatible and philosophy-aligned  
- The project maintains an open, standards-first posture

## The Point

The roadmap is not a timeline.  
It is a **direction of travel**.

The Carbon Mirror Project grows in layers:

1. Awareness  
2. Patterns  
3. Verification  
4. Tooling  
5. Community  
6. Certification  
7. Evolution  

The goal is simple:  
**Make clear thinking about digital systems the norm, not the exception.**
