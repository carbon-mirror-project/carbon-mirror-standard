# Carbon Mirror Project — Governance Model  
Updated January 2026

The Carbon Mirror Project is an open standard dedicated to improving the clarity, efficiency, and energy literacy of modern digital systems.  
To ensure consistency, neutrality, and long-term stability, the project operates under the governance model described below.

This model is intentionally lightweight at Level 1 and evolves as the Standard matures.

---

# 1. Guiding Principles

The governance of the Carbon Mirror Project is built on these foundational principles:

- **Neutrality**  
  The Standard must not privilege vendors, platforms, or specific technologies.

- **Transparency**  
  Decisions, discussions, and changes must be publicly visible.

- **Stability**  
  The Standard must not change unpredictably or in ways that break real-world usage.

- **Evidence-driven evolution**  
  Changes require clear reasoning, data, and reproducibility.

- **Inclusivity**  
  Contributors from all backgrounds and industries are welcome.

# 2. Roles and Responsibilities

The project defines the following roles:

## 2.1 Maintainers  
The maintainers are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging contributions  
- Guiding discussions and proposals  
- Ensuring consistency with project principles  
- Coordinating releases of the Standard  
- Overseeing the RFC process  
- Managing disputes and conflicts  

Maintainers have the authority to accept, request changes to, or reject contributions.

### Adding Maintainers  
New maintainers may be added by:

- Consensus of existing maintainers  
- Demonstrated long-term, high-quality contributions  
- Understanding and alignment with project philosophy  

### Removing Maintainers  
A maintainer may step down voluntarily or be removed by consensus if:

- Inactive for an extended period  
- Violating the Code of Conduct  
- Demonstrating consistent misalignment with project principles  

No single maintainer should hold unilateral long-term control.

---

## 2.2 Contributors  
Contributors include anyone who:

- Participates in discussions  
- Submits issues  
- Proposes RFCs  
- Submits pull requests  
- Provides examples, data, or patterns  
- Improves documentation  

Contributors do not require approval or formal membership.

---

## 2.3 Steering Group (Future Phase)  
As the project matures (typically around Level 3 completion), a small Steering Group may be formed to:

- Provide long-term vision  
- Review major RFCs  
- Certify formal releases of the Standard  
- Coordinate cross-industry collaboration  

The Steering Group is **not** required during early phases.

---

# 3. Decision-Making Process

## 3.1 Default Mode: Maintainer Consensus  
Most decisions—including PR reviews, clarifications, and documentation updates—are made by maintainer consensus.

Consensus does not mean unanimity; it means:

> “The maintainers can live with and support the change after discussion.”

If disagreement persists, an RFC may be required.

---

## 3.2 Formal Changes: The RFC Process  
Major changes to the Standard require a Request for Comments (RFC).

An RFC is required for:

- Modifying Mirror definitions  
- Changing certification criteria  
- Adding or removing levels  
- Introducing new measurement metrics  
- Creating or modifying audit procedures  
- Changes that materially affect existing adopters  

RFCs are:

- Public  
- Discussed in the open  
- Merged only after maintainer consensus  

The full RFC procedure will be documented in `/RFCs/` as the project matures.

---

## 3.3 Dispute Resolution  
If maintainers cannot reach consensus:

1. A public discussion is opened on GitHub  
2. Each position must provide clear reasoning and evidence  
3. After a defined period, a vote is held among maintainers  
4. Simple majority wins  
5. A dissenter may escalate to an RFC if the impact is large enough  

If a Steering Group exists, it may be used as a neutral tie-breaker for high-impact decisions.

---

# 4. Change Control and Release Cadence

## 4.1 Stability Requirements  
The Carbon Mirror Project prioritizes stability over speed.

Changes must:

- Maintain backward compatibility whenever possible  
- Include clear documentation and rationale  
- Avoid sudden or disruptive restructuring  

Breaking changes require:

- RFC  
- Notice period  
- Migration guidance  
- New version tag  

---

## 4.2 Release Cadence  
The Standard follows a staged release cycle:

- **Level 1**: Updated infrequently; only clarifications and fixes  
- **Level 2**: Updated as patterns mature and examples emerge  
- **Level 3**: Versioned as a strict specification  

Suggested cadence (non-binding):

- Minor clarifications: anytime  
- Minor structural updates: quarterly  
- Major releases: annually or semiannually  
- Certification changes: seldom and only after RFC  

---

# 5. Ownership and Licensing

The Carbon Mirror Project is licensed under **MIT**, ensuring:

- Maximum reuse  
- Maximum flexibility  
- Broad adoption encouraged  

No individual, company, or vendor owns the Standard or may claim exclusive rights to its implementation.

---

# 6. Community Participation

Participation is open to:

- Engineers  
- Researchers  
- Sustainability specialists  
- Infrastructure operators  
- Data center experts  
- Policy analysts  
- Students  
- Anyone with insight or interest  

All participants must follow the **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**.

Minimal barriers, open participation, and public visibility are core to the project.

---

# 7. Long-Term Vision

The governance structure is designed to evolve as the project evolves:

- **Level 1–2 focus**: Clarity, adoption, and text stability  
- **Level 3 focus**: Formalizing a durable, auditable standard  
- **Post-Level 3**:  
  - Steering Group  
  - Industry alignment  
  - Certification ecosystem  
  - Public Seal registry  
  - Educational resources  
  - Annual updates  

The goal is not simply to publish a standard—  
but to steward it for decades.

---

# 8. Amendments to Governance

Changes to this governance document require:

- A public issue  
- Discussion among maintainers  
- Maintainer consensus  
- (If significant) an RFC  
- Version bump to this file  

Governance must remain stable but adaptable.

---

# The Point

Governance ensures that the Carbon Mirror Standard remains:

- Clear  
- Neutral  
- Auditable  
- Credible  
- Community-driven  
- Built to last  

Good governance is not bureaucracy.  
It is the structure that protects the integrity of the Standard as it grows.
